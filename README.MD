# joytracer - a raytracer demo

This project is a raytracer demo. The purpose of this project is to learn as much as possible about C++11, 14, and 17.

## Requirements

This is what I am using:

* gcc (GCC) 9.2.0
* SDL2

I am not currently planning to test compatibility with other software versions.
